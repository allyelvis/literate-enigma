#Creating a fully functional accounting software with POS integration and modules for restaurant and hotel management along with REST API with basic authentication in Dart code is quite an extensive project and would require a significant amount of time and effort. However, I can provide you with a basic outline to get started:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

class AccountingSoftware {
  // Define properties and methods for accounting software
}

class RestaurantManagement {
  // Define properties and methods for restaurant management
}

class HotelManagement {
  // Define properties and methods for hotel management
}

class PosIntegration {
  // Define properties and methods for POS integration
}

class RestApi {
  static const String baseUrl = 'your-api-base-url.com';
  static const String username = 'your-username';
  static const String password = 'your-password';

  static Future<http.Response> postData(String endpoint, Map<String, dynamic> data) async {
    final String basicAuth = 'Basic ' + base64Encode(utf8.encode('$username:$password'));
    final response = await http.post(
      Uri.parse('$baseUrl/$endpoint'),
      headers: <String, String>{
        'Authorization': basicAuth,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
      },
      body: jsonEncode(data),
    );
    return response;
  }
}

void main() async {
  // Example usage of REST API
  final response = await RestApi.postData('your-endpoint', {'key': 'value'});
  print('Response: ${response.statusCode} ${response.body}');
}
```

This is just a starting point, and you would need to expand on each class with more specific functionalities based on your requirements. Additionally, you'd need to implement the backend logic for the REST API endpoints and integrate them with your accounting, POS, restaurant, and hotel management modules.
